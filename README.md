# Vigilaveris + Web Integration

This is the first application of the web system we've been developing, and it's gonna tie in with work for Vigilaveris, my alarm clock project.
This is everything:
 * Files for the website
 * Arduino files to handle serial
 * Library header files for server code
 * Customized python that interacts with flask server

Right now, the goal is to have a system working that can live fft audio, plot a mass spectrogram, etc. and have it such that 1. The python file I modify that returns fft stuff only has to talk to the server.py file with one line. And then have a thread that can constantly be checking the time and use the alarm when the alarm needs to do the alarm thing. All without failing, etc. Should be fun.

## How to Set Up
